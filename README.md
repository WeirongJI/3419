# TaskA file includes:

1. Souce code: TaskA.ipynb
2. Folder: video - saves the input video &quot;monkey\_TaskA.mov&quot;.
3. Folder: frames - saves all the frames of &quot;monkey\_TaskA.mov&quot;.
4. Folder: result - saves the result frames after drawing arrows which represents displacement vectors of the object motion.
5. output\_video\_TaskA.mov: the final expected output.

# To get the source code running in order to derive the expected output, you need:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook, find the folder you save the source code.
2. Open the source code and run it sequentially.
3. Then you can get the output saved in different files.
